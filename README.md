## MyPlot
This project implements a rough, start-from-sketch tool to draw 2D and 3D mathematical functions and graphs in C++. This is a universial function grapher that can adapt to draw any mathematical functions. Some examples are shown below. This project was part of the final project of Tsinghua University's Program Design course.
### Examples
- Function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(x)=x"/> from -10 to 7
![func1](./res/func1.png)
- Function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(x)=x^2"/>
![func2](./res/func2.png)
- Parameter functions in the shape of heart
![func5](./res/func3.png)
- 3D function in the shape of hat
![func6](./res/func4.png)
### Usage
To draw customized graphs using this tool, call either `plot2D`(for unary functions), `plotPara` (for parameter functions), or `plot3D` (for 3D graphs) in `plot.cpp` with the customized functions written in the form of C++ functions.
### Collaborator
This project was done in collaboration with Tsinghua freshmen Yifu Tang, Haimeng Zhao, and Yichen Zhang (in no particular order).
